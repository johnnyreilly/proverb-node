# Proverb

Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.  

This repository is using the following technologies:

- NodeJs / Express
- MongoDb
- TypeScript 1.4
- AngularJS 1.3

The focus of this repository is porting proverb-offline to NodeJs.

## Getting Started

You need to install [node and npm](http://nodejs.org/). Once you've done that you'll need to install Gulp and Bower globally at the command line:

```
npm install -g bower
install npm -g gulp
```

Inside the Proverb.Web folder you'll need to install the packages that Gulp and Bower use, to do that just type:

```
bower install
npm install
```
